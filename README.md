A *nix-y watchface for the Pebble

A terminal looking watchface for the Pebble Smartwatch that appears to use the Linux `date` command to display the time.

# Inspiration

This face was inspired by [this](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/3905/10185/) face that I came across shortly after buying my Pebble. 

However I am not a big Windows fan so I thought I'd create a *nix one.
